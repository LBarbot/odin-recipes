    <h1>Goulash</h1>

    <br>
    <p>Traditional Hungarian goulash is a beef and vegetable dish seasoned with paprika that is usually served over buttered noodles for a hearty, satisfying meal. The amounts of garlic, onions, and especially paprika may seem excessive, but they all melt into an incredibly rich and flavorful pan gravy during the slow cooking process. The sauce is further enriched by the addition of sour cream. It is important that you use sweet Hungarian paprika, not a generic or Spanish variety, as the Hungarian spice is a key ingredient and gives the goulash its signature taste.

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 to 3 pounds boneless chuck roast, cut into 1-inch chunks</li>
        <li>Kosher salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>4 medium sweet onions, sliced and separated into rings</li>
        <li>8 ounces baby portobello mushrooms, or cremini, brushed clean and sliced in half</li>
        <li>1 head garlic, about 12 cloves, peeled; large cloves cut in half</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sweet red wine</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups beef broth</li>
        <li>1 (4-ounce) jar roasted red peppers</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sweet paprika</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>4 cups cooked buttered noodles</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
    <li>Place beef chunks in a large bowl. Sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper and toss with the flour.</li>
    <li>Heat a heavy Dutch oven over medium-high heat and add 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Swirl to coat the bottom of the pan.</li>
    <li>Place beef chunks in a single layer and brown on two sides. (You will probably need to do this in batches; do not crowd
    the meat or it will boil instead of brown.)</li>
    <li>Remove browned beef to a bowl.</li>
    <li>Reduce heat to medium-low. To the drippings in the Dutch oven, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil, onion rings, mushrooms, and garlic. Toss to coat with the olive oil.</li>
    <li>Cover tightly and sweat the vegetables, stirring occasionally, until onions are limp but not browned and mushrooms are
    releasing their liquid, about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add red wine to the vegetables and cook 2 minutes, scraping up browned bits from the bottom.</li>
    <li>Add beef broth, roasted red peppers, and paprika.</li>
    <li>Return beef and any accumulated juices to the pan. Stir until well-combined.</li>
    <li>Cover tightly, reduce heat, and simmer on low heat for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, stirring occasionally, until beef is
    fork-tender.</li>
    <li>Remove Dutch oven from heat and wait for boiling to subside. Taste and add additional salt if necessary. Stir in sour
    cream until completely incorporated into the gravy.</li>
    <li>Serve Hungarian goulash over hot buttered noodles with chopped parsley.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
