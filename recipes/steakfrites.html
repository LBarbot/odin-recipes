        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>8-10 sprigs of fresh thyme</li>

    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Butter: Add the butter to a stand mixer with the paddle attachment and whip on high speed until light and fluffy, about
        5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Next, add in the rosemary, thyme, green onions, garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, and pepper until combined. Set
        aside.</li>
        <li>Fries: Add the fries to a container of cold water and move around with your hands to get some of the starch off.
</li>
        <li>Drain and rinse the potatoes again and drain off any excess water.
</li>
        <li>Place them in a deep fryer or a pot of oil at 300° for 3 minutes.
</li>
        <li>When ready to serve turn the heat to 350° and cook for 3-5 more minutes. Toss with salt in a bowl and serve.
</li>
        <li>Steak: Season the steak on both sides with salt and pepper.
</li>
        <li>Add the oil to a large frying pan over high heat. Once smoking, add in the strip steak and turn the heat down to medium.
</li>
        <li>Add in the thyme, garlic, and butter and cook for 3-5 minutes per side for a medium-rare internal temperature.
</li>
        <li>Once you flip the steak over baste the steak until it’s done.
</li>
        <li>Rest the steak for 3-4 minutes before slicing and serving with some of the butter and fries.
